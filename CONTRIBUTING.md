# Setup
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). During install, make sure ".NET desktop development" is checked.
2. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download). During install, change "Use Git from Git Bash only" to one of the other two options, depending on your preference.
3. Clone the repository by opening command prompt/powershell in the folder of your choice and typing `git clone https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker`.
4. Download the recommended latest [nuget executable](https://dist.nuget.org/index.html) and copy it into your PATH, or where you cloned the git repository (where bootstrap.ps1 is).
5. run bootstrap.ps1, preferably from a powershell window to see any errors.
6. Open the solution file with VS17 and do a build to make sure everything is working properly.

# Contributing

## Contributor License Agreement

HearthSim requires a signed CLA from any contributor before his/her PR can be merged.

### What's a CLA?

> A CLA is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute
the code/documentation/translation to the project youâ€™re contributing to and are
willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that
should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and
ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary
forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this
contribution.

> The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try
to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can
therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using
pieces of the code at a later date.

### Why?

HearthSim uses a Contributor License Agreement to ensure we can legally use,

## Project approval

For trivial changes or fixes (i.e. a couple lines of code) on new or existing issues and projects feel free to just open a PR.

We would like to avoid wasting your time, so for non-trivial changes or fixes please do one of the following before starting to work on it:
- For work on an existing issue please comment on that issue and wait for approval.
- If no issue exists, please open a new issue with the proposal and wait for approval.
- Propose the project in #hdt on the [Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/hearthsim-devs) and wait for approval.

## Coding style

1. Always use tabs.
2. Use LF line endings.
3. Always place braces on new lines.
4. Use [C# 6](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/New-Language-Features-in-C%23-6)/[C# 7](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/08/24/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/) syntax whenever possible. 
5. Follow the [standard MS C# naming conventions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002(v=vs.110).aspx) 
([short version](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/224910)). 
Also see: [How to name things in programming](http://www.slideshare.net/pirhilton/how-to-name-things-the-hardest-problem-in-programming)
6. Know when to make exceptions.

## Commits and Pull Requests 

Keep the commit log as healthy as the code. It is one of the first places new contributors will look at the project.

1. No more than one change per commit. There should be no changes in a commit which are unrelated to its message.
2. Follow [these conventions](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) when writing the commit message.
3. Keep the diffs as clean as possible. Avoid unnecessary line changes.

When filing a Pull Request, make sure it is rebased on top of most recent master.
If you need to modify it or amend it in some way, you should always appropriately 
[fixup](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) the issues in git and force-push your changes to your fork.
